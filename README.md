# EMOTOCode
There are a total of eight algorithms and nine problems.EMOTO is the proposed algorithm and the others are the comparison algorithms.
The operating environment is the simulation software Abaqus CAE.Each subfolder has four files: two.py files for running and finding optimization results,.cae for the model file, and.ini for the configuration file.
Next, we will specifically introduce how to run it.
# RUN
1.Setting the working path
Put the four files that need to be experimented in the same folder and set up the working directory in Abaqus, as shown in the figure:

2.run .py file
Once you have your working directory set up, click Run Scipt from the File menu and select [Algorithm name].py to run it.As shown here:

3.Viewing the results
Once the algorithm is running, re-open Abauqs and repeat steps 1 and 2. In step 2, select the displayResults.py file and select the structure you want to view (.odb), as shown:
